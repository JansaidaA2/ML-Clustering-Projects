Clustering Projects Repository
Welcome to my Clustering Projects repository! This repository contains a collection of clustering projects that I have worked on, showcasing various clustering algorithms and techniques. Each project is implemented using Python and includes a detailed explanation of the methodology, code, and results. Some projects also feature interactive frontends built using Streamlit for a more engaging user experience.

Projects Overview
1. DBSCAN Clustering
Description: This project demonstrates the use of DBSCAN (Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise) for clustering data points based on density. DBSCAN is particularly useful for identifying clusters of varying shapes and sizes, as well as detecting outliers.

Key Features:

Implementation of DBSCAN algorithm.

Visualization of clusters and noise points.

Explanation of DBSCAN parameters (eps, min_samples).

2. Hierarchical Clustering for Mall Customers Dataset
Description: This project applies hierarchical clustering to the Mall Customers dataset to segment customers based on their spending behavior. The project includes an interactive frontend built using Streamlit, allowing users to explore the clustering results.

Key Features:

Implementation of hierarchical clustering (Agglomerative Clustering).

Dendrogram visualization.

Interactive Streamlit frontend for exploring customer segments.

Insights into customer behavior based on clustering results.

3. K-Means Clustering for Mall Customers Dataset
Description: This project uses the K-Means algorithm to cluster customers in the Mall Customers dataset based on their annual income and spending score. The project also includes a Streamlit frontend for interactive exploration of the clusters.

Key Features:

Implementation of K-Means clustering.

Elbow method for determining the optimal number of clusters.

Interactive Streamlit frontend for visualizing clusters.

Analysis of customer segments and their characteristics.

4. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for Iris Dataset
Description: This project demonstrates the use of PCA for dimensionality reduction on the Iris dataset. PCA is used to reduce the number of features while retaining the most important information, making it easier to visualize and analyze the data.

Key Features:

Implementation of PCA for dimensionality reduction.

Visualization of the Iris dataset in 2D and 3D using the principal components.

Explanation of variance explained by each principal component.

Insights into how PCA can be used for data visualization and clustering.
